# Description

This is the repository for our [CodeDay](https://www.codeday.org/) Game app 2020. We are all classmate from NSCC , We have taken CSC 142 and CSC 143 together.

There was so much new to learn because most of us only knew to code with Java language. First, we learned how to install and use Android studio then learning the tools from libGdx library for developing the 2d game. The other thing we had to learn was GitHub which helped us a lot on coordinate with the team and organize our strategies. And the most challenging part was probably dealing with game dynamics. 

We started this journey without any idea of how to develop a game, neither did we have an idea for a game yet. In 2 weeks we had to develop an idea and learn a lot of tools to bring it to life and we had so much fun in the process.

# The Game
We all brainstormed up ideas around the theme "Just Click That Button". After drawing some simple diagrams the group decided to go with the Bee Game because it was cute, simple, and could be expanded upon easily if we wanted to make it more complex. Also, with bees dying out due to the pesticide being a real problem, it seemed like a good idea to bring attention to in our game (the player bee really does lose health due to picking up pollen with pesticide on it). The original idea was that we would hit buttons on the flowers to collect the pollen, but as we learned more about LibGDX (a Java Game Library) we realized it would better for gameplay if we had the pollen be picked up by "colliding" with the flower pollen" 

# Tecnology learned:
- libGDX (Java game engine)
- git (Most of our team didn't know how to use git or knew very little)
- Game development strategies (Sprites, Screens, Actors, Stages, etc)
- Android Studio IDE (Neither of us had used it before)

# Set up instructions
- clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/KristinJJ/GameAppCodeDay.git
```
- On Android Studio select "Open an existing Android Studio Project" and open the SaveTheBees directory. It should have a littel android icon indicating that this is an Android Studio Project.
- To launch the Desktop version of the application, on Android Studio, right click on the DesktopLauncher.java file under desktop/java/com.spelunkers.game.desktop/ and select ```run 'Desktop'```
- All the Graphics will go into the android/assets/ directory.
