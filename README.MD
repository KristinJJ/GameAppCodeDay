# Description

This is the repository for our [CodeDay](https://www.codeday.org/) Game app 2020.

We started this journey without any idea of how to develop a game, neither did we have an idea for a game yet. In 2 weeks we had to develop an idea and learn a lot of tools to bring it to life and we had somuch fun in the process.

# Tecnology learned:
- libGDX (Java game engine)
- git (Most of our team didn't know how to use git or knew very little)
- Game development strategies (Sprites, Screens, Actors, Stages, etc)
- Android Studio IDE (Neither of us had used it before)

# Set up instructions
- clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/KristinJJ/GameAppCodeDay.git
```
- On Android Studio select "Open an existing Android Studio Project" and open the SaveTheBees directory. It should have a littel android icon indicating that this is an Android Studio Project.
- To launch the Desktop version of the application, on Android Studio, right click on the DesktopLauncher.java file under desktop/java/com.spelunkers.game.desktop/ and select ```run 'Desktop'```
- All the Graphics will go into the android/assets/ directory.
